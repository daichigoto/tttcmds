Build and Use
-------------

### FreeBSD 11+

###### PATH

Add tttcmds/bin to the PATH environment variable.

###### Build

    sudo pkg install kyua

    cd tttcmds
    make clean build

### Windows 10+ (You need [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/))

###### Winget

- Install "[App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/p/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA-%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC/9nblggh4nns1)" via Microsoft Store
- Install "[Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases)"

###### PATH 

Add the following paths to the PATH environment variable with the following priorities.

1. ${HOME}\Documents\misc\bin
2. ${HOME}\Documents\tttcmds\bin
3. C:\msys64\usr\bin
4. C:\msys64\mingw64\bin

###### HOME
Add the environment variable HOME. The value should be the user's Windows home directory, such as "C:\Users\daichi". If this environment variable is not specified, the MSYS2 home directory will be like C:\msys64\home\daichi where is not home directory of Windows.

Windows home directory and MSYS2 home directory are different. By setting the value of the environment variable HOME as described above, you can change the home directory of MSYS2 to the home directory of Windows. If you want to use Windows and MSYS2 in a more integrated way, this setting can help. If you want to keep your home directory different, there is no need to set the environment variable HOME.

###### LC_CTYPE

Add the environment variable LC_CTYPE. The value is "ja_JP.UTF-8". If you don't specify this environment variable, MSYS2's vim, etc. will not be able to use Japanese properly.
