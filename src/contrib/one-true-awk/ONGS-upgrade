The following functions were added for this import:

	ssvstr2str(s) - output the string from the SSV string s.
	str2ssvstr(s) - output the SSV string from the string s.
	v2s(s) - shortname of the ssvstr2str(s).
	s2v(s) - shortname of the str2ssvstr(s).

And the following files were modified for those.
